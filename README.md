# Ecommerce Service

It's very simple service designed to manage certain pool of orders, provide some basic informations like Clients with biggest carts per Category, the most popular Product per Category etc.

Data about Customers and Products will be loaded from JSON file in a way that match bussiness logic that I was working with.

At this point it's fully testable.

Project is part of a learning so I'm happy to get any valuable feedback :)
